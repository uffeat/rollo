- Split up into modules
- Transfer non-standard handler to relevant parcels
- Consider inlining core handlers (sources, types and processors)
- Consider refactoring 'use' from proxy to patched-up function to avoid issues in Anvil... On the other hand, as long as 'assets' is exposed that can be used in Anvil instead.
