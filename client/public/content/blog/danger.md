# Everyday danger

The picture is often surprising. The highest risk comes from small, common creatures that spread disease or live near people. Big predators matter in specific regions, but everyday exposure drives most harm.

# Quick list

- Mosquitoes spread malaria, dengue, and more in warm climates.
- Humans cause harm through violence and accidents.
- Snakes cause severe bites in rural regions with limited care.
- Dogs transmit rabies where vaccination coverage is low.
- Freshwater snails carry the schistosomiasis parasite.
- Crocodiles attack near rivers and lakes during low visibility.

# Where risk is highest

Risk climbs with heat, poverty, and proximity to water. Rural communities face more exposure to venomous snakes, crocodiles, and parasite hosts. Urban density increases encounters with mosquitoes and dogs. Among snakes, the saw scaled viper stands out across arid regions, small and well camouflaged, quick and irritable.

# Stay safe

- Use treated nets and remove standing water.
- Vaccinate dogs and seek post exposure care fast.
- Wear boots and use lights at night in snake country.
- Give rivers and murky banks wide clearance.
