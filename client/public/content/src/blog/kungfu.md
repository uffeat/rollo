# Wing Chun: efficient movement and calm focus

Wing Chun is a compact Southern Chinese kung fu system built on economy of motion, centerline theory, and relaxed structure. It favors short, direct techniques that intercept rather than clash, using timing, positioning, and sensitivity to control the exchange.

Core ideas:

- Centerline: protect and attack along the shortest path.
- Structure over strength: elbows in, shoulders relaxed, hips aligned.
- Forward intent: pressure without overcommitting.
- Sensitivity: chi sao drills develop reflexive responses.
- Simplicity: fewer techniques, more repetition.

Training roadmap:

1. Siu Nim Tao &rarr; build alignment and intent.
2. Chum Kiu &rarr; integrate turning, stepping, and power.
3. Chi Sao &rarr; refine touch, timing, and adaptability.
4. Conditioning &rarr; forms, wall bag, footwork, and sparring constraints.

Why it resonates:

- Efficient for smaller practitioners.
- Emphasizes calm decision making under pressure.
- Scales from forms to constrained sparring to live application.

Tip: keep shoulders soft, elbows tracking the center, and let the stance carry your structure. The shortest path is only effective when the whole body stays unified and relaxed.
